// In order to show creativity, I implemented a Library class which contains a library of scriptures and will randomly choose one at the start of the program
// for the user to memorise.  The list of scriptures can be expanded by calling the AddScripture method.

        // What does the program do?  It is a scripture/poem memorizer thingy, that basically takes some passage of text and over time obscures random words.
        // User Inputs: Basically just the one of either press ENTER or type QUIT.
        // Output: The partially/fully obscured passage of text, and a prompt to continue.
        // How does it end?  Writing QUIT or EXIT, or all of the words are now obscured.

        //Classes: Scripture (keeps track of the words and reference, can display the words and hide them.), 
        // Reference (Book, Chapter, Verses information), Word (Keeps track of the word, and probably a bool of shown/hidden).

        // Class Methods and Attributes:
        // Scripture [HideRandomWords(numtohide), GetText(), IsTotallyHidden()] - [_reference, _listOfWords]
        // Word [Hide(), Show(), IsHidden(), GetText()] - [_text, _hidden]
        // Reference [Constructor(), GetText()] - [_book, _chapter, _startVerse, _endVerse]

And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.");
