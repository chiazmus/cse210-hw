If I had one more thing I could do over today, what would it be?
What was the best part of my day?
How did I see the hand of the Lord in my life today?
What was the strongest emotion I felt today?
If I had one thing I could do over today, what would it be?
What was something interesting that happened to me today?
What was the most difficult decision I made today?
Did anyone inspire me today?
